# Godot Game
 experimenting with godot

## Major Idea - Guck and Ball torture (GNBT)
 - waves of gore balls, physics everything (need to optimise)
 - emergent gameplay from fun physics
 - bouncing, jump pads, ice patches (skating)
 - more movement
 - points awarded based on coolness (no clamp on camera rotation)
 - balls coalescing into something, more balls, other stuff
 - open playground type levels

PHYSICS INTERPOLATION MANUAL VS INBUILT IDK

WEIRD ROCKET DAMAGE ✔️

ADD VELOCITY METER ASAP ✔️

enemies hit player and velocity goes bananas

~ADD SLOWER MOVEMENT ACCEL~

## Goals (old)
 - ~~first person character~~
 - ~~movement tech, sprinting, jumping~~
 - ~~shooting~~ -> projectile weapon after
 - experiment with graphics -> not sure if low res or high res
 - ~~basic enemy ai~~ -> make them scary
 - item pick ups - roguelike?
 - more interesting terrain
 - hp bar and ~~points~~
 - enemy damage to player
 - interactable level changes by player
 - fade in/fade out animation for the big circle object
 - enemy idea because FUCK animating -> big cube, it moves by rotation around, falls to pieces when dead
 - smoke cigarettes
 - ~speed counter~
 - ~deathbox~

Movement
 - ~lerp over with velocity~
 - chromatic aberation with velocity
 - camera shake?
 - zoom effect

Weapons
 - flamethrower
 - gravity gun
 - laser
 - ~rocket launcher~
 - sound of bullet casings landing? (awesome)
 - SHOTGUN IMPULSE? 
 - ~SHOTGUN MUZZLE FLASH~
 - ROCKET GLOW EMISSION

guck cube
 - spit green projectiles
 - ~movement (jumping? sliding? rolling?)~
